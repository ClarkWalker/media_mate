<h1 id="media-mate---a-proper-media-centre.">Media Mate - A Proper Media Centre.</h1>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>The problem currently with media centres is that to make one, you need to go through all sorts of setup, which is time consuming and mentally draining.</p>
<p>Another big problem with media centres, is that you need to have many programs running at the same time, wasting precious system resources.</p>
<p>To give you an example of what I mean - I have a media centre myself. I have to use <a href="https://sonarr.tv">Sonarr</a>, <a href="https://plex.tv">Plex</a>, <a href="https://transmissionbt.com">Transmission</a> and <a href="https://couchpota.to/">Couchpotato</a> for what seems like a simple job.</p>
<p>With such a large amount of information from so many sources, it becomes difficult to keep on top of it all.</p>
<p>Leisure time should be, as the name suggests, easy. I aim to provide a solution to this information overload with a focus on the particular area of media (TV, movies, music etc).</p>
<h1 id="why-i-chose-this-problem">Why I chose this problem</h1>
<p>I chose this problem because it is one that has plagued me for many years. I used to work around it by using a virtual machine, and only booting it when I needed to. This is very inefficient, as you have to think about it constantly, wondering if there is something to download / watch.</p>
<p>Instead of having to run 5 different programs, why not run one that does everything those 5 programs which I mentioned earlier do. The result will be an well organised, easy to set up media centre.</p>
<h1 id="interaction">Interaction</h1>
<p>The user will interact with the program by interacting with UI elements such as buttons, links, video controls, etc. Below is a UI draft of the start page.<br />
