## What is it?

Media Mate is a media centre, along the lines of [Plex](https://plex.tv), with the features of [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv), downloading and organising your media in a good looking way. Media Mate also allows you to automatically download the shows that *you* want to watch, thanks to [ShowRSS](http://showrss.info/).
